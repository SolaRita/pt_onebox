# Onebox Event Reservation Client

This project is a technical test for ONEBOX conducted by Rita Sol√†. It is developed using Angular 17 and Tailwind CSS. The application utilizes HTTPClient for API communication, RXJs for reactive programming, and OnPush change detection strategy for performance optimization.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a web client for managing event seat reservations with various sessions and availabilities. The system comprises a main view displaying a list of currently available events (catalog) and a detailed view (event details) containing a list of available sessions for that event and a shopping cart.

## Development Server

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. Install Angular CLI globally if not already installed:

   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

2. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd PtOneboxRitaSola
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```
   ng serve
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the application. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.
